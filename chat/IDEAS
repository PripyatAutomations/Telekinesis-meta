* Like IRC but with priorities for messages (low, routine, priority, urgent)
* Tree based mesh
* A good effort should be made to send the message to all channel members
  - Send via IP if connected, first
  - Send via RF directly, if possible
  - Send via RF multi-hop using routing from last-heard data in the DHT
* Censor out bad words and replace them with tokens that can be expanded at client end.
* Allow store and forward for messages of a minimum priority
